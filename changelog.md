Changelog:
- Added a new file: `.github/workflows/build.yml`  
- This file sets up a GitHub Actions workflow namedBuild CI that triggers on push and pull request events.  
- The workflow runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and includes a build job with a matrix strategy for multiple compilers (gcc-10, gcc-11, clang-13, clang-14).  
- The job sets the environment variable `PREFIX` to `/usr/local/bin` and `CC` to the respective compiler from the matrix.  
- The job includes the following steps:    
- Checkout the code using `actions/checkout@v3`.    
- Display the compiler version using `${CC} -v`.    
- Run `make` to build the project.    
- Run `sudo make install` to install the built project.    
- Run `ldd $PREFIX/mdp` to display the shared library dependencies.    
- Run `$PREFIX/mdp -v` to display the version of the installed project.
